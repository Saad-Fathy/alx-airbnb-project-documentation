Airbnb Clone Backend User Stories
Overview
This directory (user-stories) contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend, as part of the ALX Airbnb Project Documentation. The user-stories.md file translates the use case diagram from Task 1 into user-centric stories, capturing core interactions such as user registration, property booking, payments, and more. These stories align with the features from Task 0 and the database schema, supporting the RESTful API design.
Files

user-stories.md: Contains at least 5 user stories describing actor interactions with the system.
README.md: This file, explaining the purpose and context of the user stories.

User Stories Details
The user stories are derived from the use case diagram (Task 1), covering interactions for:

Actors: Guest, Host, Admin.
Core Functionalities: User registration, property creation, property search, booking creation, payment processing, review submission, messaging, and admin booking management.
Format: Each story follows “As a [actor], I want to [action] so that [benefit].”

The stories ensure user-centric descriptions, supporting real-world Airbnb-like scenarios and RESTful API endpoints (e.g., POST /users, POST /bookings). They align with the database schema (User, Property, Booking, etc.) and cover key use cases from the diagram.
