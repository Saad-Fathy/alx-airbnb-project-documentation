Features and Functionalities
The Airbnb Clone backend supports the following features, designed to mimic core Airbnb functionalities and support a RESTful API.
1. User Management

User Registration: Create accounts with first name, last name, email, password, phone number (optional), and role (guest, host, admin, or both).
User Login: Authenticate users via email/password, issuing a JWT for secure access.
User Profile Management: View and update profile details (e.g., phone number, password).
Role-Based Authorization: Restrict actions based on role (e.g., hosts create properties, admins manage users).
Password Security: Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.
Account Deletion: Delete user accounts, cascading to related data (e.g., properties, bookings).

2. Property Management

Create Property: Hosts create listings with name, description, location, and price per night.
Update Property: Hosts update property details (e.g., price, description).
Delete Property: Hosts delete properties, restricted if active bookings exist.
List Properties: View all properties or filter by location, price, etc.
Property Details: Retrieve details for a specific property, including reviews and availability.

3. Booking System

Create Booking: Guests book properties for specific dates, calculating total price.
View Bookings: Guests view their bookings, hosts view bookings for their properties, admins view all.
Update Booking Status: Hosts/admins update status (pending, confirmed, canceled).

4. Payment Processing

Process Payment: Integrate with Stripe/PayPal to process payments for bookings.
Payment Confirmation: Store payment details (amount, method, date) linked to a booking.
Refund Handling: Process refunds for canceled bookings.
Payment Security: Use HTTPS and gateway encryption for secure transactions.

5. Review System

Submit Review: Guests submit reviews (rating 1–5, comment) post-stay.
View Reviews: View reviews for a property or by a user.
Edit/Delete Review: Guests edit/delete their reviews, with time restrictions.

9. Security and Compliance

GDPR Compliance: Support data privacy (e.g., user data deletion).

10. Error Handling and Logging

Standardized Error Responses: Return consistent errors with HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 401).
Logging: Log events (e.g., failed logins, payment errors) for debugging.
User Feedback: Provide clear error messages (e.g., “Property not available”).

Diagram
